# Hi, I'm Ahmed 👋 

I'm a Software Engineer, working mostly with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Angular**. I focus on building educational platforms and service-based web apps that people actually use.

Right now, I'm deep into mastering the **core backend layer** with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture** — keeping code maintainable, testable, and not just "working."

I’m one of those rare devs who’s pretty good at **UI/UX design in Figma**, but I’ll admit — I enjoy designing interfaces way more than developing them (even though I’m decent at both).

If you're into backend architecture, clean code, or you're just curious what I'm working on — feel free to check out my work below 👇
